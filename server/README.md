# Catstronauts - server

The starting point of the `server` code for Odyssey Lift-off I course.

## Which npm packages did we use
- **apollo-server**: provides a full-fledged, spec-compliant GraphQL server with some nice utilities like the gql template literal
- **graphql**: provides the core logic for parsing and validating GraphQL queries.
